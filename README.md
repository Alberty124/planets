# Joshua's Simple Webpage 

*The purpose of this website is to demonstrate github pages capabilities.*

## CCOM 4029

This website is designed for the CCOM 4029 course in the Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de RÃ­o Piedras.

Here, we can see a simple block which can be used to display code:

    python:
    temp = "Hello World!"
    print(temp)

## Plans for the future

I plan to add/update the site with a css template since that is what the professor asked us to do.
Once I have done that, I will add more stuff here.
