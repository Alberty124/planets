# Joshua's Simple Webpage 

*The purpose of this website is to demonstrate github pages capabilities.*

## CCOM 4029

This website is designed for the CCOM 4029 course in the Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de RÃ­o Piedras.

Here, we can see a simple code of python:

    ```python
    temp = "Hello World!"
    print(temp)
    ```

While here, we can observe a c++ program:

    ```cpp
    string temp = "Hello World!";
    cout << temp << endl;
    ```

## Plans for the future

I plan to add/update the site with a css template since that is what the professor asked us to do.
Once I have done that, I will add more stuff here.
